## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to serve the files
3. Configure the back-end API endpoint in the JavaScript files (currently using dummy data)
4. Set up a database to store the rental data

## Technical Implementation

This web application is built using:

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling (responsive design, grid layout)
- **JavaScript** for client-side functionality

For a production environment, you would also need:

- A backend server (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
- A database (SQL Server, as used in the original application)
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
